This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` initially, leading to errors when your component tries to access the width or height properties. This is asynchronous, and the dimensions aren't immediately available.
